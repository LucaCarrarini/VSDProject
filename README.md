# Vehicle System Dynamics Project: Design and analysis of a KERS system for a F1 car
The dependence of the transportation sector on non-renewable sources of energy as fossil fuels and the need for a rapid response to the global warming challenge has in the last
two decades encouraged a strong effort for the development of fuel efficient vehicle propulsion systems. In this context, a particular attention has been devoted to the concept of
regenerative braking. A regenerative brake is a mechanism that reduces the vehicle speed by converting some of its kinetic energy into some other kind of useful forms of energy, such as mechanical, electrical or hydraulic energy. A type of regenerative braking is called KERS (which stands for Kinetic Energy Recovery System).This is an automotive system for recovering a moving vehicle kinetic energy under braking.
